## Generate structured JSON from tables in scientific articles

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://vgvinter-tabletojson-app-kt5aiv.streamlit.app)

## Getting Started

```python 
from TableToJson.jsonformer_non_tokens import JsonformerNoTokens, OpenAIModel, highlight_values

builder = JsonformerNoTokens(
    model=OpenAIModel("text-davinci-003", debug=False),
    json_schema=json_schema_example,
    text=html_table_example,
    prompt="Generate a object with the following schema extracting the information from the provided table in html code:",
    temperature=0.5,
    debug=True,
    max_array_length=10,
    max_string_token_length=10,
)

result_example = builder()

highlight_values(result_example)
```


## ðŸš€ Installation

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/vgvinter/TableToJson.git
```


## :memo: Description

The input to obtain the JSON format of a table is the DOI identifier of a research paper and the table number in the article. Using the `selenium` library, the HTML code of the table contained in the paper is extracted. Then, using the OpenAIâ€™s models structured JSON is generated from the table HTML.

The code to extract the table HTML from the paper DOI is in `html_table.py`. The code to generate JSON using OpenAIâ€™s models is in `jsonformer_non_tokens.py` (based on: https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer and https://github.com/martinezpl/jsonformer/tree/add-openai, Copyright (c) 2018 Rahul Sengottuvelu).


### Examples

The generation of structured JSON for different tables extracted from research papers on several topics is shown in Jupyter Notebooks in the main directory. Examples with the use direct of the OpenAI model and with the use of an OpenAI model combined with `jsonformer` are shown .

The HTML code for the example tables is in the `html_tables` folder. The JSON schemas provided to the model to generate JSON are in the `json_schemas` folder. The generated JSON for all the examples using the OpenAI model directly is in the `structured_openai_results` folder. The generated JSON for all the examples using the OpenAI model and `jsonformer` combined approach is in the `structured_jsonformer_results` folder.

The results can be visualized in this [demo app](https://vgvinter-tabletojson-app-kt5aiv.streamlit.app/).
